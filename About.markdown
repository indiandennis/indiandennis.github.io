Hi. I'm a student in San Jose, California, who enjoys working with technology. I do lots of stuff
such as photography, graphic design, web design, rendering, and lots more. In the past, I've created
concept computer designs, websites, t-shirt designs, and done networking. On this blog, I like to share
things which I like, such as music, photos, videos, and my opinions. Enjoy. Or don't. You are most likely
a real human being which entitles you to your own ideas.
