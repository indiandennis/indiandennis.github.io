## The Fate of Mankind
    I had previously written a very long, detailed article highlighting how the destiny of man was to continue to propel our civilization forward, and that the purpose of our lives is to aid the progress of humanity as much as possible. However, my content editor glitched out and somehow lost my great article. So instead, I bring you, "The Fate of Mankind".
    
    Before man, there were many species which were on top of the world. They were the obvious alpha of the animal kingdom, and dominated everything underneath them. Most of those animals are now extinct. Many fear that humanity will be the same.
    However, they forget that humanity is unlike any other species which has ever existed. We have grown at a rate faster than any other species, polluted at a rate higher, and killed at the highest rate of all. While these facts may seem arguments that mankind will go extinct, they are quite the opposite.
    The simple fact of the matter is that humanity will undoubtedly find some way to screw over every single thing which threatens us, whether it be accidental or intentional. If the planet throws storms and droughts at us, we will pollute it until even we can't live on it anymore. If rocks fall from space, we will build machines to shoot them down.
    Even if we are forced to move to another planet or into space, we will never, ever go extinct.
