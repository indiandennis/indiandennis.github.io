It is at times late during the night when our minds truly feel the most free. That time of darkness, when you know that most people are still awake but you feel as if you are alone in the world. Combine this feeling with a Friday night and nothing to do over the weekend, and the emotions find themselves being put into words. So here is a short piece about the periodic human brain relaxation we call sleep.

The modern version of sleep is not the one scientists believe humans have had for our entire existence. Prior to industrialization, humans slept for about four hours, then woke once again for an hour or so. This was the hour in which some of the greatest people in the world did their work. During this magical hour, the pituitary hormone prolactin is released, which leads to a more peaceful state of mind. This feeling is similar to the state of mind experienced directly before sleep and directly after waking.

However, as time has progressed and civilization has industrialized, humans have diverted from this sleep pattern. We choose to sleep for short amounts of time; to sacrifice sleep before all else, as if we do not need to rest at all. Because of our use of technology and electric lighting in the modern world, our brains never truly want to go to sleep anymore. Only when the lights are completely off, the blinds are down, and the screens are off do we truly feel tired. Unfortunately, this is one of the burdens of our society. We constantly feel the pressure to do more in the short amount of time we have awake, but instead we choose to stay less efficient and elongate our waking hours instead.
